# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a simple neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

</a>

## 📌 Overview

The notebook demonstrates:

* Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
* Building a fully-connected neural network using both the **Sequential API** and **Functional API**.
* Training the model and evaluating accuracy.
* Visualizing predictions using `matplotlib`.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The final model uses the following architecture:

* Input Layer: 784 units (28x28 flattened)
* Dense Layer: 512 units with ReLU activation
* Dense Layer: 256 units with ReLU activation
* Output Layer: 10 units with Softmax activation (for digit classification)

## ✅ Results

* **Training Accuracy:** \~99%
* **Test Accuracy:** \~97.8%

## 🔍 Example Prediction

A random image from the test set is selected and displayed, along with its predicted and actual label.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Venky474/demo.git
   cd demo
   ```
2. Open the `MNIST.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or click the **Open in Colab** badge above.

## 📦 Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## 📂 Dataset

The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded via TensorFlow:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```
